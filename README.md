This repository contains my code from George Mason University's CSI 873 machine learning course taught in the Computational Science and Informatics graduate program. I took the class in the fall semester of 2017. We used the text Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell (1997). I am not posting the slides, data, or textbook so as not to infringe on anyone's copywrite. 

Note: the best quality code will be in the ".Rmd" files. Those are what I turned in. Everything in "scripts/" should be suspect. It was my sandbox. Caveat emptor!
